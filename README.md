# summer-internship-2017

This repository was created as a part of summer internship 2017. The main aim of the project was to enhance current Scalarm system by dockerizing its services. Docker-compose.yml was created to connect all the dockerized services.

Actually Data Explorer and Experiment Supervisor (Pathfinder) do not work properly. More on wiki (link below).

More information (in Polish) on [Documentation](https://github.com/Scalarm/summer-internship-2017/wiki/Podsumowanie/_edit).
